	<div class="question"> This is the Cocktail DB API, available for free from Rapid API. It
		has many functions all centered around cocktails! Here I've used it
		as a random cocktail generator, but it could also be used to lookup cocktails by name
	or ingredient while filtering by things like Glass Shape or Alcoholic / Non-Alcoholic.</div>

	<div class="question"> This API can be found at: https://rapidapi.com/theapiguy/api/the-cocktail-db?endpoint=apiendpoint_b2280d27-a2ef-4de9-be14-8c3f88f2d9ec</div>

	<div class="question"> I had to set some request headers in order to access this data 
	[x-rapidapi-host: the-cocktail-db.p.rapidapi.com] as well as [x-rapidapi-key: 
	042bde6587mshd6ee5cb1ae07dc7p118916jsn5b843a8f8de]. Other than that I used [xhr.open("GET", 
	"https://the-cocktail-db.p.rapidapi.com/random.php", true)] in order to use the GET method
	to get a random cocktail asynchronously </div>

	<div class="question"> The random generator would be a great addition to a cocktail supply store
	 website. I'm excited just browsing these, and I'd be likely to order the ingredients from an
	 adjacent page. You could also use it as a part of a fun party app to give ideas
	 to those who lack a diverse knowledge of cocktails.</div>
